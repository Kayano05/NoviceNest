This project is a front-end project that utilizes npm (Node Package Manager) Vue CLI (Vue.js Command Line Interface) scaffolding and Element UI. The “dist” folder contains the packaged output of the front-end project. To integrate this front-end project into a Spring Boot Web project, you need to copy all the contents from the “dist” folder into the “static” folder within the back-end project.
